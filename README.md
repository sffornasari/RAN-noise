# RAN-noise
Collection of scripts to evaluate the RAN noise levels.

The script should be used in the following order:
1. preprocessing/compute_full_psd.py
2. preprocessing/compute_oto_psd.py
3. preprocessing/compute_psd_P_timeseries.py
4. analysis/compute_jsons.py

Figures in the paper are created with the following codes:

Figure 1 - plotting/noise_sources.py \
Figure 2 - plotting/plot_numberofdays.py \
Figure 3 - plotting/PSD_ts_plot.py
Figure 4 - plotting/general.py \
Figure 5 - plotting/PDFPSD_plot.py \
Figure 6 - plotting/day_night_dif.py \
Figure 7 - plotting/weekday_weekend_dif.py \
Figure 8 - plotting/seasonal_dif.py \
Figure 9 - plotting/covid_general.py \
Figure 10 - plotting/covid_day_night_dif.py \
Figure 13 - plotting/station_hourly_avg.py \
Figure 15 - plotting/car_sta.py \
Figure S1 - plotting/all_periods_general.py \
Figure S2 - plotting/covid_weekday_weekend_dif.py

**N.B. The paths to the files must be checked and updated before running the scripts.**
