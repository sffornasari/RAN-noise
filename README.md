# RAN-noise
Collection of scripts to evaluate the RAN noise levels.

The script should be used in the following order:
1. preprocessing/compute_full_psd.py
2. preprocessing/compute_oto_psd.py
3. preprocessing/compute_psd_P_timeseries.py
4. analysis/compute_differences.py
5. ...

Figures in the paper are created with the following codes:

Figure 2 - plot_numberofdays.py \
Figure 3 - \
Figure 4 - general.py \
Figure 5 - \
Figure 6 - day_night_dif.py \
Figure 7 - weekday_weekend_dif.py \
Figure 8 - seasonal_dif.py \
Figure 9 - covid_general.py \
Figure 10 - covid_day_night_dif.py \
Figure 13 - station_hourly_avg.py \
Figure 15 - car_sta.py \
Figure S1 - all_periods_general.py \
Figure S2 - covid_weekday_weekend_dif.py \
